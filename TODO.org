* Doom TODOs
** [ ] Fix colliding key bindings, especially C-s
The key bindings seem to be tweaked for Evil mode in particular, so they collide
with "vanilla" Emacs key bindings. Especially really basic ones, like Isearch,
which is not acceptable for my usage. (Too much muscle memory.)

** [ ] Fix weird bug where for some reason flyspell is highlighting "correct" words
For example, "timezones" was getting highlighted, but Ispell was saying it was
actually correct. It appears that "--run-together" is the cause.
